## 🧠 **LogAI – Product Summary (MVP)**

### 🔍 **Purpose**

A tool that allows you to **analyze and query application logs using natural language**, powered by a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline.

---

### 🎯 **Core Features**

1. **Log Ingestion & Analysis**
    
    - Accepts `.log`, `.txt`, or `.json` files.
        
    - Parses and breaks them into smart chunks.
        
    - Embeds the chunks and stores them in a vector database.
        
2. **RAG-Based Natural Language Querying**
    
    - You can ask questions like:
        
        - “What failed in the last 6 hours?”
            
        - “Were there any auth errors yesterday?”
            
    - The tool retrieves relevant log chunks and sends them with your question to an LLM for an answer.
        
3. **Watch Mode (Optional)**
    
    - Can monitor a directory and auto-ingest logs in real-time.

### 💡 **Problems It Solves**

- **Context Limit in LLMs**: Vector DB stores the logs, and only the relevant context is sent to the LLM.
    
- **Hard-to-Search Logs**: Makes querying logs as easy as asking a question.
    
- **Multi-file log chaos**: Combines and normalizes logs from many files for better debugging.
    
- **Manual triaging**: Offers summaries, clustering, and insights over raw logs.
